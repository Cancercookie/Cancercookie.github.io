					Hello world, I'm Jari. I'm very unoriginal and stereotypical dev, creator of this small website to showcase what I can do and also have a place to dump some ideas.
					</p><p>
					I was always passionate about tech and nerdy subjects since I was young and dedicated my life to it.
					</p><p>
					I studied IT and got my degree in IT Science in University of Bologna in December of 2019.
					</p><p>
				    I worked as a Front End developer since 2018 starting with Angular2+ and then moving to React.
